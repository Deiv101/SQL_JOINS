SQL INNER JOIN

Below is the basic syntax of Inner Join.

SELECT Column_list
FROM TABLE1
INNER JOIN TABLE2
ON Table1.ColName = Table2.ColName

Inner Join syntax basically compares rows of Table1 with Table2 to check if anything matches based on the condition provided in the ON clause. When the Join condition is met, it returns matched rows in both tables with the selected columns in the SELECT clause.
